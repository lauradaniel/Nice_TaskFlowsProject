I have a 3-level categorization of customer intents from call transcripts in the "Categories" section. 
I also have a snippet from a customer service transcript.

Please label each line in the transcript using one of the existing Level 3 (L3) intent names. 
Output a CSV with the format: Intent,LineNumber

Only use the L3 categories listed. Do not create new intents. Avoid vague or overlapping labels.

# Categories
{categories}

# Transcript
{conv}
