You are given a list of predefined categories organized hierarchically, and a list of reasons that customers mentioned during calls.

Each reason should be matched to the best fitting category from the list.

Return your output as a CSV with these columns:
Index, Original Reason Text, Best Matching Category (L1 - L2 - L3), L3 Score (1-5), L2 Score (1-5), L1 Score (1-5)

Only output the CSV â€” no extra commentary.

# Categories
